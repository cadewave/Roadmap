    <h1>Frontend development</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong> Frontend development </strong> involves creating the user
      interface and experience of a website or application. It focuses on using
      technologies like
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> ,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> , and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
        >JavaScript</a
      >
      to build visually appealing, responsive, and interactive designs. Frontend
      developers ensure seamless navigation, performance, and compatibility
      across devices, enhancing the overall user experience.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>HTML : </strong><i>(HyperText Markup Language)</i> is the
        standard language for creating web pages. It structures content using
        elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. HTML provides the
        foundation for web development, enabling browsers to display text,
        images, and multimedia, forming the backbone of websites in conjunction
        with CSS and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong> CSS :</strong> <i> (Cascading Style Sheets) </i> is a
        stylesheet language used to control the presentation of HTML content. It
        defines styles for elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and
        spacing. CSS enhances the visual appeal of web pages, enables responsive
        design, and allows for consistent styling across multiple pages,
        improving the overall user experience.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong> JavaScript :</strong> is a versatile programming language used
        to create dynamic and interactive web content. It allows developers to
        implement features like form validation, animations, and real-time
        updates. As a core web technology alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript
        enhances user experiences and enables complex functionalities in modern
        web applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>**Introduction to Frontend Development**</h2>
    <p>
      Frontend development refers to the practice of building and designing the
      part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It
      is the "client-side" portion of development, as opposed to the backend,
      which deals with the server-side processes. Frontend developers focus on
      the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure websites are
      visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate.
    </p>
    <h3>**Key Technologies in Frontend Development**</h3>
    <p>
      Frontend development relies on a set of core technologies that form the
      foundation for building websites. These include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b> **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** </b>
        HTML is the basic structure of web content. It is used to create the
        skeleton of a webpage, including elements like headings, paragraphs,
        links, images, and forms. HTML defines the content and structure of a
        webpage, providing a framework for additional styling and functionality.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b> **Angular** </b>
        Angular is a full-fledged frontend framework developed by Google. It
        provides a comprehensive solution for building dynamic web applications,
        including tools for data binding, routing, and form management. Angular
        is based on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which adds static
        typing to enhance scalability and maintainability.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b> **Vue.js** </b>
        Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build modern web
        interfaces. Vue is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of
        integration with existing projects. It allows developers to create
        interactive UIs with minimal setup.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b> **Bootstrap** </b>
        Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed
        components (like buttons, navigation bars, and modals) and a responsive
        grid system. It helps developers create mobile-first websites quickly,
        without having to design elements from scratch.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><em> **Additional Frontend Technologies**</em></h4>

      src="/images/angu-removebg-preview.png"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
      alt="language"
    />

    <button class="accordion">1. **TypeScript**</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types, making
        code easier to understand, debug, and scale. It’s becoming increasingly
        popular in frontend development for its benefits in large applications,
        offering better tooling and error checking during development.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">2. **Sass/SCSS**</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nested
        rules, and mixins, which allow developers to write cleaner and more
        maintainable stylesheets. SCSS is a syntax of Sass that’s more CSS-like
        and easier to integrate into existing projects.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">3. **Version Control Systems (Git)**</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Git is an essential tool for frontend developers, as it allows them to
        track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage the
        codebase. Platforms like GitHub or GitLab are widely used for hosting
        code repositories and version control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>**Conclusion**</h4>
    <p>
      Frontend development is a dynamic and evolving field that requires a
      strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity
      with various tools and libraries. By combining these technologies,
      frontend developers create engaging, responsive websites and applications
      that provide an excellent user experience. As technology advances,
      frontend developers must stay updated with the latest frameworks and best
      practices to build the next generation of web applications.
